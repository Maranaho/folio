Hey Maranaho, 

As mentioned, Gus and I just caught up with the A4A panel and discussed what we are looking for with the Design Technologist here in the UK. I have outlined this all below and given an overview of the A4A interview process to help you prepare. Alice will be in touch directly to coordinate times (and will work around your availability as well).

Once you have had a chance to digest this we can catch up and I would be happy to walk you through any specifics or answer any questions you might have.
